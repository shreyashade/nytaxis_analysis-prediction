NYC Taxi Fare Analysis and Prediction  This project explores and analyzes New York City's iconic yellow taxi data to uncover trends and build a predictive model for trip fares. We clean the dataset, visualize temporal and spatial patterns, and evaluate various machine learning models, ultimately achieving the best results with Linear Regression.
